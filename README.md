## Hey, I'm Derek!

MS Computer Science @ Northeastern (April 2026)  
3 years at Zoox working with autonomous vehicle fleets

### Featured Project

**[Sentinel](https://github.com/DerekZ-113/Sentinel)** — Context-aware alert filtering for AV fleets. Built an XGBoost classifier that reduces false positive alerts by 64%. The interaction features that made it work came from watching thousands of alerts and learning which ones actually needed attention.

### Background

I started at Zoox as a Software Testing Specialist running overnight operations on a 500-vehicle autonomous fleet. After three years of watching operators get buried in false alerts, I built Sentinel to fix it. Now I'm finishing my MS and looking for software engineering roles.

# Hey, I'm Derek!

MS Computer Science @ Northeastern (April 2026)  
4 years at Zoox working with autonomous vehicle fleets

## Featured Projects

[**Sentinel**](https://github.com/DerekZ-113/Sentinel) — Context-aware alert filtering for AV fleets. Built an XGBoost classifier that reduces false positive alerts by 64%. The interaction features that made it work came from watching thousands of alerts and learning which ones actually needed attention.

[**PatternBank**](https://pattern-bank.vercel.app) — Cross-platform spaced repetition app for LeetCode interview prep. SM-2 scheduling, pattern confidence heatmap, localStorage-first architecture with Supabase cloud sync. Web + React Native mobile.

## Background

I started at Zoox as a Software Testing Specialist running overnight operations on a 500-vehicle autonomous fleet. After three years of watching operators get buried in false alerts, I built Sentinel to fix it.  

After solving 347 LeetCode problems and forgetting most of them, I built PatternBank to fix that too. Now I'm finishing my MS and looking for software engineering roles.
